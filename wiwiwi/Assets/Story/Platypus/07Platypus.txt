This is the best fish soup I've ever had! It reminds me of my mother's cooking.

Is your mother a fisher too?

Yes, my whole family!

My son and daughter, grandma and grandpa, great grandma and great grandpa were all fishers!

You had children, Mr. Platypus?

Mr. Platypus

GibberishPlatypus
Yes, but it gets harder to catch fish, especially in the wintertime.

Mr. Platypus

It's only natural for us to live in solidarity and fish on our own.

Mr. Platypus

GibberishPlatypus
My children left me when they were just four months old! They were expert fishers by then already.

What a great idea! You can move in with us! It must've been hard living by yourself all this time.

...Thank you, but I'm afraid that I cannot help you with anything.

My back's all worn out and I cant even catch fish anymore.

But you helped me learn how to fish!

If you stay with us you can teach us how to fish and we can continue your lineage of fishermen as family!

Mr. Platypus

Haha, I guess I could stay for a while then.
