Woah! Is that a boat? It's so huge! I've only seen those in story books!

Yes...It's my old companion that has kept me company while fishing around. I can't fish anymore so I'd like to give it to someone who still can.

Of course, its been a long time since I could use it. I've only kept it around because it kept me company, but since I have a new family now I have no need for it.
